## JWT-AUTH
Just a basic api, for learning the process of jtw.

### Code
In this code I do a register/login logic, and add middleware on others routes(single findAll images route). On GET request of images route is used auth middleware to verify if the request contains a valid token.

### This project was made following a tutorial found on internet
[How to Build an Authentication API with JWT Token in Node.js](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-build-authentication-api-with-jwt-token-in-nodejs/)
